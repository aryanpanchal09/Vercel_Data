    Audience sentence imagine can't stop reading in the middle, As they are modeling it in their brain 
    
    Always use Active Sentence (It's creates a illusion that it's happening right in front of them)
    
    Instead of telling them that thing was terrible describe it so well that thy we'll be terrified 
    
    Show not tell 
    
    Don't use word like "delightful" "terrible" instead user should fill it while reading or watching 
    
    It will feel real b'ca Audience own incessant model - making imaginations 
    
    Use Metaphorical words 
    	Ex - he had a ROUGH day instead of he had a bad day 
    It will help the audience understand better, "And then will just create confusion"
   
   Cause and Effect should be suggested rather than explained 
   
   The only way you can describe a human being truly is by describing it's imperfection as it's fascination to the audience they will relate more to that character

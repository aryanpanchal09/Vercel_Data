00:00:01	Warren Buffett it's the sound of money 9.2 and the second richest religion is estimated to be worth about sixty two billion dollars makes him the richest man in the world you know Buffett is not exactly what you might expect even though he's in the money business he doesn't even own a calculator or a computer he takes the long view and it's made him billions many billions maybe you can beat the house but I don't think he could beat Warren Buffett Buffett filed his first tax return at 13 years old but he's no average

00:00:41	billionaire top he certainly doesn't matter he's a 44 billion dollar average Joe Warren Buffett has an approach that doesn't make him very popular with his fellow billionaires Warren Buffett the boy from Nebraska who's grew up to become the wizard of Omaha what was it about him that allowed him to become the richest man in the world how did he do it seventy years ago I was in high school almost a third as long as the country has been around and when I was in high school I really only had two things on my mind

00:01:29	girls and cars and and I wasn't doing very well with girls so we'll talk about cars but let's just imagine that when we finish I'm gonna let each one of you pick out the car of your choice sounds good doesn't it pick it out any color you name it it'll be tied up with a bowl and it'll be at your house tomorrow and you say well what's the catch and the catch is that it's the only car you're going to get in your lifetime now what are you going to do knowing that that's the only car you're ever going to

00:02:09	have and you love that car you're going to take care of it like you cannot believe now what I'd like to suggest you're not going to get only one car in your lifetime but you're gonna get one body and one mind and that's all you're gonna get and that body and mind feels terrific now but it has to last you a lifetime on the way to the office it's a all of a five minute drive then doing it for 54 years one of the good things about this five minute drive is that on the way there's a McDonald's sauce pick up something

00:02:58	McDonald already Oh muffin with egg and cheese that's that thank you and I tell my wife as I shave in the morning I say either to 61 to 95 or 317 and she puts that amount of the cup by me here and that determines wish of three breakfasts I get to 95 great you're on candid camera I see when I'm not feeling quite so prosperous I might go with the 261 was just - sausage patties and then I put it together and pour myself a cold hi how are you 3:17 has a bacon egg and cheese biscuit but the markets down this morning so I

00:03:53	think I'll pass up to 317 ago for the June 55 I like numbers started before I could remember it just felt good working with numbers I was playing around with numbers in one way or another and it was fun to have a bunch of guys over in heaven betting on which Marvel would reach the drain first I had a lot of energy as a kid I was inquisitive and I was the youngest one always in the class cuz I'd skip I'm always been competitive I like to read more than most kids I really like to read a lot my auntie knee gave me a copy of the

00:04:46	World Almanac and that was heaven to me and I can still tell you that almost population was 214 thousand and six in 1930 some numbers just gotta stick with you and very early probably when I was seven or so I took this book out of the Benson library called a thousand ways to make a thousand dollars and one of the ways in this book was having penny weighing machines and I sat and calculated how much it would cost to buy the first weighing machine and how long it would take for the profit for that one to buy another

00:05:21	one I would sit there and create these compound interest tables to figure out how long would take me to have a weighing machine for every person in the world I had everybody in the country waiting themselves 10 times a day and he's just sitting there like john d rockefeller wings you can sit the allowance when I was a little boy it was a nickel a week but I like the idea of having to work with then I went into business very early they started selling coca-cola door-to-door I sold gotten door-to-door

00:05:55	or so Saturday and closed Liberty magazine Ladies Home Journal you name it I think I enjoyed the game almost right from the start but I like being my own boss that's one thing I liked about delivering papers I could arrange the route I wanted nobody was bothering me at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning [Music] I was delivering five hundred papers a day and I made a penny of paper but in terms of companies had penny certain to something else [Music] Einstein is reputed to have said that compound interest is the eighth wonder

00:06:41	of the world or something like that and it goes back to that story you probably learned when you were in grade school where somebody did something for the king and the king said what can I do for you and he said well let's take a chess board and put one kernel of wheat on the first square and then doubled it on the second and doubled it on the third and the King readily agreed to it and by the time he figured out what to to the 64th him how did to he was giving away the entire kingdom so it's a pretty simple

00:07:10	concept but over time it accomplishes extraordinary things Berkshire is an amazing company and fourth largest company in the fortune 500 he is the only person who has ever from scratch built a company that is in the top 10 of the fortune 500 well Berkshire is a holding company of sorts it owns a large number of separate businesses that operate independently of each other and to a great extent from the parent company Berkshire Hathaway we have maybe 70 maybe 80 businesses and we ask them to behave in a way that

00:08:10	doesn't hurt our reputation at Berkshire Hathaway but they run their own lives other people do most of the decorating of the office so various things come in originally when I moved in in 1962 you can see this I went down to the South Omaha library and I think for a dollar I got seven copies of old New York Times from from big times like the panic of 1907 this is one 1929 obviously but I wanted to put on the walls days of extreme panic and Wall Street just as a reminder that anything can happen in

00:08:54	this world I mean it's it's instructive art you can call it [Music] I was born in 1930 here in Omaha Nebraska during the stock market crash well my dad lost his job in 1931 a year after I was born he was a sock salesman and he had what little savings he had in the bank and so he started his own company he worked right through the depression do you had an investment company and as it I don't look back Wow did that ever take a lot of nerve sometimes we'd go down there on Sunday and we could play with the adding

00:09:45	machine my brother and I tended to play the games together and I remember at one point he said to me I'm going to be a millionaire by the time I'm 30 she's like that it was totally outside of anything my family had experienced but he just was unusual that way [Music] well I was the oldest and then my brother and then my sister and my father would go to New York periodically to check on businesses and stocks and things like that and we come back he always had a costume for each of us and Warren loved it

00:10:22	it was very good-natured he was quiet it was hard to tell he was a genius at that point but I mean who was looking the first books I read on investment we're actually in my dad's office pretty soon I read all the books in the office and read some of them more than once my dad had various nicknames for me he'd call me fireball sometimes because I'd start little businesses he didn't care about money at all he believed very much and having an inner scorecard and I never worried about what other people

00:11:00	are thinking about you know just just do you know why you're doing what you're doing that's good enough I admired everything about him to the extent that I was absorbing lessons from him without knowing it and the idea that all eyes have equal value is something that all three of his children felt since I can remember my dad at one point ran for Congress when I was 12 or so it was a very Republican household I can't paid for my sister's campaign for him the whole family did [Music] my mother was very very bright and she

00:11:42	was very gregarious she was a good campaigner for my dad she had a lot of ambition and I think my brother Warren got a lot of his extreme competitiveness from my mother actually she was brilliant at math you know I guess they still had these things where you crank them and things added up and she could add it in her head faster than the machine could do it she was absolutely amazing in that she was very beautiful about taking care of the kids but you didn't get the same feeling of love it was there but it does

00:12:18	it didn't come out the same way as with my dad in the nation the only permanent way to prosperity is a violence budget unless that goal is achieved all post-war plans will collapse like Hitler's conquest you have very song tristan Howard LH puppet Republican member of the House of Representatives from the blaster when I was about 12 or 13 we moved to Washington my family and I was mad I was having fun in Omaha I lost all my friends and now I moved to a town where they were all strange and so I was very

00:12:54	very unhappy and school I just lost interest I took pleasure in tormenting my teachers at that time for example AT&T was the stock that all teachers own for their retirement and I decided that it would drive my teachers a little crazy if I went short the stock because when you go short a stock you're betting that it will go down so I shorted thin shares of AT&T and brought the confirmation to schools so these teachers that was shorting the stock they'd find me a big pain in the neck but they did think I knew a lot about

00:13:34	stocks and then the home my mother would have terrific headaches and you didn't want to be around her when she was having the headaches and she would she would lash out more she would never do it in public I think we were terrified of her when I wake up in the morning I listen to hear her voice I could tell by a voice was gonna be a terrible day or not when she got difficult the three children Feldon when I was at the low point sort of I decided I would run away so I talked to other guys under running

00:14:14	away with me we went out and we started jogging and then we got picked up by the Highway Patrol and that scared the hell obvious and very interesting my dad never really gave me help about doing this but he finally said you know he says you can do better than this and just saying that I mean I I felt I was letting him down basically so in all ways he was teaching me never taught by telling me things he just taught by example he had unlimited confidence in me even when I screwed up and that takes you a long long way

00:14:57	the best gift I was ever given was to have the father that I had when I was born [Music] I didn't want to go to college I was 16 when I got out of high school and I was buying stocks I mean I actually was having a pretty good time and I didn't see that it really was much to be gained by going to college but my dad kind of Jah lead me into it he had a roommate who was a friend of mine and the roommate said interest drive him crazy because he studied all the time when Moore would come in like 15 minutes before the exam and just aces

00:15:34	way through it I finished in three years because I had enough credits then I was in a hurry I wanted to get out when I got on the University of Nebraska I applied to Harvard Business School they told me I was to get interviewed in a place near Chicago I got there and he interviewed me for about ten minutes and he said forget it going to Harvard and so now I'm thinking what do I tell my dad yeah is it terrible and it turned out to be the best thing ever happened to me later that summer I was looking

00:16:12	for a catalog and in the catalog it had these names of people that were teaching and one was Graham and there another was Doc I had read this book by the two of them so I wrote him a letter in mid-august and I said dear professor God I said I thought you guys were dead but now that I found out that you're alive and teaching at Columbia I would really like to come and he admitted me so it just shows you never can tell a gentleman that's rare Ben was this incredible teacher I mean he was a natural and he drew us all in

00:16:56	a more accurate in the short term in the long term forecast well our studies indicate that you have your choice between tossing coins and taking the consensus of expert opinions and the results are just about the same in each case it was like learning baseball from the fellow it was batting 400 it really it shaped my professional life there are two rules of investing according to Warren and he learned this from Ben Graham rule number one never lose money rule number two never forget rule number one

00:17:41	Ben Graham basically coined the term value investing he believed in careful scrutiny of a company's financial statements and that if you bought value it would eventually prove out a few years ago I went to Amazon sure enough they had this manual there so reliving my use other guys were going to Amazon probably in and a final play boys or something but I bought old Moody's manuals instead and when I got school I started selling stocks that was 20 years old at the time and looked about 16 enacted about 12 so I was not the most

00:18:22	impressive salesperson anybody ever met but what I would do was I I went to a page-by-page looking for possibly undervalued stocks is this like going through an old family album better [Music] when I got out of business school at Columbia I developed pretty decent skills in terms of business but I hadn't really come to terms of the world exactly what were you like around girls back then bad I I was sort of out of the swing of things there for a while I went to my 60th reunion there's a girl there I took her out one time to the

00:19:06	Uptown Theater and Washington and I asked her whether she remember what movie we saw and she said no I don't remember that then she said but I didn't remember one thing and I get Eddie and I said what was that and she said well you picked me up in a hearse and that was true that I owned a half interest in her hearse when I was in high school which was not the smoothest thing that their coolest as I would say now the thing that you could you could do on a date [Music] there were two turning points in my life

00:19:36	once when I came out of the woman was a basic [Music] she was the girl yeah but if there were little longer to figure out I was the boy I was going to be his younger sisters roommate at Northwestern so I walked into their house and he was sitting in this chair and he made some sarcastic wit so I may run back I thought who is this jerk and that's how we met yes listen Warren they're smarter than you even though here's a brain it's going all the time and my dad said to me now you have to understand about him you're

00:20:27	not gonna have discussions with him like you would most normal people but he has a heart of gold he was just totally namma to her and why not and she of Jim she sit on his lap all the time he'd stroke her hair it was softening him Susie was really kind considerate and she was the balancing force I [Music] just got very very very lucky but I was a lopsided person and it took a while but she just stood there with a little watering can and just nourished me a long end and changed me somebody once said that the chains of

00:21:16	heaven are too light to be felt until they're too heavy to be broken I had been terrified of public speaking I couldn't do it and throw up and I know if I didn't cure it then they never cured and so I so I'd add in the paper to the Dale Carnegie wash which worked on developing your ability to speak in public and I went down there they made us do all these crazy things to get out of ourselves and so we stood on tables and did all kinds of things I hadn't have done that my whole life would have been different

00:22:04	so in my office you will not see the degree I got from the University of Nebraska they'll not see McMasters degree from Columbia University but you'll see the World War certificate I got from the Dale Carnegie course the matter of fact every week the instructor would give a pencil to whoever had done the most with what we've learned the week before and so in the fourth or fifth week I proposed to her mother and she said yes and so that week I won the pencil and I also got engaged and it was an incredible week

00:22:46	Wendy it was kind of interesting because I couldn't see anything without my glasses and I was so nervous that I I just decided take off my glasses and I wouldn't be able to see all those people up there [Music] she was 19 when we got married I was 21 but she was so much more mature than I was there's no comparison she was a better person than I was but when you get married it's not a question to say I want to put a 14% factor in for humor and 17% for intellect and 22% less it doesn't work that way I

00:23:30	knew it was the right decision and and it was [Music] you could live anywhere in the world why'd you choose Omaha Nebraska I love it I you know I've been born about a mile from here and you know I've never had a bad experience in Omaha [Music] Omaha Nebraska home to me everything about it seems like home it's a pace it's relationships there's a lot of continuity there's a lot of community there's a lot of friendship it's a very solid place and friendly place in which to grow up and in which to conduct a business

00:24:30	[Music] when I came back to Omaha in early 1956 I had no idea of what I was going to do but a few months after I came back some members of the family said what should we do with our money and I said well I'm not going back in the business of selling stocks but if you would like to join me in a partnership I said I'll be glad to do it so within a couple of months after coming back I set up the first partnership I [Music] wrote all the checks individually I filed eleven income tax returns I took the delivery on stocks for all of the

00:25:10	different coming I I was a one-man band that her for six years why would sit upstairs in this little office there and I would bring up the name of a company and most of the time he knew much more than I did about the company he'd know how many shares were outstanding you know the capitalization you know the earnings it was absolutely incredible I mean when Warren said something you've met a heck of a lot and I think all of us paid a lot of attention to one when he took a definite stand on something

00:25:45	when I first met Warren back in 1959 I recognized immediately that he was a very intelligent first for the last four or five years the stock market has been booming along and presumably forecasting better business which is really not materialized so maybe the stock market is really correcting a previous incorrect forecast this time rather than making a new correctly he'd made a lot of money buying thinly traded securities that were incredibly cheap statistically Warren was at that time dealing with

00:26:23	small companies and his investments often were to buy a company that you could figure was a discarded cigar bun but it had one more smoke in it and he wanted to buy at the right time to be able to benefit from the one smoke the first partnership started with a hundred and five thousand one hundred dollars I put up one hundred and the other people put up a hundred and five thousand and then at the start of 1962 I moved to qa+ and by the time I moved to Cuba Caza we had seven million dollars invested and fair amount was profits

00:27:01	I was then renting a house I never owned a house to that point and then two years later I bought the house I live in today in 1958 [Music] we had three children Susie and I and we had him young incidentally which was I think a very good thing [Music] my daughter says he was born here I named her Suzy just like that as soon as I looked at her you know just like her mother and she was essential and then how it was you know this absolute bundle of energy which made things very difficult for for big Susan for a while

00:28:02	[Music] Peter again reverted back to Suzie's personality and he was an easy child you know I described my childhood as normal but who knows what normal is people often think you know well Warren Buffett was this famous rich guy he was I famously wasn't rich when we were growing up what I saw first and foremost day in and day out was consistency every day we'd hear the garage door closed in the house and then my clockwork my dad would come in the door at home and we'd all eat dinner together which I think

00:28:44	surprises a lot of people my dad used to rock me to sleep at night and sing over the rainbow so I have this insanely sentimental attachment to that song I've always had a really close relationship with him [Music] I've got three very different kids and they've got a common heart which they got from their mother she did most of the work by far bringing up the children which is probably a good thing they have more of her qualities than my widget yeah I would I would recommend them well my mom was the biggest part of my

00:29:27	life growing up even though I got disciplined on a regular basis that she was usually the one doing it she was still my best friend she was somebody who would help anybody I mean whether she knew or didn't know them or maybe even didn't agree with them she would still help them she was incredibly empathetic and she was interested in every person individually she never cared about money or business at all I mean he would go around saying I'm going to be the richest man in the world and I think brought it's like

00:30:02	somebody says I play music and I'm gonna be Mozart I don't know how does anyone know how does he know know so that word okay I don't really care about that I would say that Susie led Warren toward changing his political views he grew up as a young Republican his father was a Republican congressman but Susie saw things in different ways she was the catalyst [Music] when the children were growing up I was very involved in civil rights I was immersed in it and I think that's what made Bernie Democrat he would go with me

00:30:53	to hear speakers I remember that speech that Martin Luther King gave that was my most inspiring speeches I had I've ever heard took me right out of my seat my wife was with me and we both had the same experience it was interesting he in that speech he talked about truth forever on the scaffold wrong forever on the throne but that scaffold sways the future well he was going to be dead in six months but that scaffold did sway the future my wife was more active than I was but I was out a percent with her mentally a

00:31:32	dud was just working a little more on my own investments but it didn't make a difference what we were gonna do with the money after we made it I thought I would pile it up over the years then she would until-- it in terms of running a one very large foundation and I was particularly good at compounding money and therefore society would benefit by waiting I [Music] was genetically blessed with a certain wiring that's very useful in a highly developed market system where there's lots of chips on the table and you know

00:32:07	I happen to be good at that game Ted Williams wrote a book called the science of hitting and in it he had a picture of himself at bat and the strike zone broken into I think 77 squares and he said if he waited for the pitch that was really in a sweet spot he would bat 400 and if he had to swing at something on the lure corner he would probably bat 235 investing I'm in a know called strike business which is the best business you can be and I can look at a thousand different companies and I don't have to

00:32:40	be right on every one of them or even fifty of them so I can pick the ball I want to hit and the trick in investing is just to sit there and watch you pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot and the people are yelling swing you bum ignore them there's a temptation for people to act far too frequently and stocks simply because they're so liquid over the years you develop a lot of filters but I do know when I call my circle comp so I stay within that circle and I don't worry about things that are

00:33:17	outside that circle defining what your game is where you're going to have an edge it is enormous ly important I bought the first shares of Berkshire in 1962 and it was a Northern textile business destined to become extinct eventually and it was a statistically cheap stock in a terrible business Berkshire Hathaway was closing Mills and as they closed the mills it would free up some capital and then they would repurchase shares so I bought some stock with the idea that there would be another tender offer at some point and

00:33:59	we would sell the stock at the modest profit and the management asked me at what price we would tender our stock and I said $11.50 [Music] and the tender offer came out of few months later and it was a $11 and 3/8 was an eighth of a point cheaper and that may be very mad so I just started buying more stuff I just felt that had been double-crossed by the management and then in May of 1965 but bought enough so we control the company and we changed the management that was a pretty silly way to behave as

00:34:46	warm as recounted in retrospect one of the reasons weren't successful is he's brutal in appraising his own past he wants to identify Miss thinking's and avoid them in the future but it was an accident that he chose Berkshire Hathaway if the Chairman hadn't tried to cheat him out of an eighth there wouldn't have been any Buffett - Berkshire Hathaway history if you're emotional about investment you're not going to do well you may have all these feelings about the stock the stock has no feelings about you

00:35:20	looking back it's interesting that tender offer I didn't realize it but it happened about five days after my dad had died and I whether that an effect of me or not I don't know do you remember your last conversation with your father yeah but I talked about I think it just sobered him and hurt him but or in soldiers on both Warren and I could look at our fathers and see what they didn't write what they did wrong one's father was a real old-fashioned right-wing ideologue and his father was so intense about it that Warren just

00:36:15	decided that his mistake has cabbage DUP your head to be that much of ideologue so he loved his father but he didn't want to become that much better or believer and in anything my politics became more overt after my dad died civil-rights changed my views you know in 1776 Thomas Jefferson wrote all men are created equal and then when they wrote the Constitution they all of a sudden decided that no it was just three-fifths of a person if you were black I mean that struck me as kind of crazy I was talking to one day about some

00:36:55	racial issue and he said to me wait till women discover their the slaves of the world now how many men were cognizant of that and even women men the initial examples really my mother she came from a generation where the main function of the wife was stuff help her husband in the job and my sisters are fully as smart as I am they've got better personalities than I have but they got the message a million different ways that their future was limited and I got the message that the sky is the limit and it wasn't due to a lack of

00:37:38	love or anything of a sort it's just it was the culture on the other hand you can look at the flipside and say it's quite encouraging because if you look at what this country accomplished only using half of its talent you know just think of the potential for the future I'm enormous ly bullish on America over the future and part of the reason is that we buy a some other stupid decisions essentially put half our talent on the sidelines Warren is probably the most rational person I've ever met Charlie Munger

00:38:08	would be a close rival and Charlie became a man that Warren depended on heavily and I think his first experiences in the discarded cigar butt era convinced him that it was not exactly where he wanted to be he made so much money for so long doing what he'd been taught by Ben Graham we should buy these very cheap stocks if they were cheap enough he didn't care it was a lousy company and lousy management he knew he was gonna make money anyway just because of the cheapness Charlie Munger's bet a big impact on me

00:38:44	and moving me toward looking for wonderful companies at fair prices rather than fair companies at wonderful prices and that was enormous ly important because it enabled Berkshire to scale up in a way that would have been impossible to do otherwise yep what are the key indicators you look for within companies before making an investment well I look for something that does give them a motor Rob we have a company called See's candy out on the west coast sees candidates watch chocolates if you give a box of

00:39:20	chocolates to your girlfriend of the first day and she kisses you we own do you know we we can raise the price tomorrow I go by this a box you're not gonna fall out with success so the key there is the response you do not want to go home on Valentine's Day and say to your wife or your sweetheart preferably they're the same person you don't say here honey I took the whole bit it doesn't work prices to a degree is immaterial if you've got a economic council people are gonna come in want to take that council away from you and you

00:39:56	better have a strong vote you better have a night miss castle that knows what he's doing you're not buying an asset through buying a name you're buying a brand you're buying a real franchise here and Charlie was more responsible for that than anybody we were metal partners right from the moment we met I know going back 50 years what it was like when you first met Warren well I thought he was a prodigy and I got a lot of criticism my wife said why are you paying such enormous respect of a young man with a crew cut

00:40:34	vegetables ungodly smart he's got a much broader intellect of an idea and he's magnificent at being able to condense important ideas and the just a very few words if you're not interested in the economic scene right now you're mentally dead Charlie has no tact all right let's talk a little bit about bankers Charlie on Friday compared them to heroin addicts yeah well that's colorful Charlie but I would not have chosen that I once wrote of him that when they handed out humility he didn't get his fair share

00:41:12	the ideal way to run a headquarters is to have one man preferably over 80 sitting in an office by himself anything else is pure for every he's always honest then what he tells me so I listen to him we never had an argument we just we just kind of roll with it easily suppose Warren doesn't want to do something that I would have done and suppose that happens four times over four years what the hell difference does it make to me net the record is working out fine both of us know that we've done better

00:42:01	by having ethics warrants not interested in making money by cheating people warrants opinions of Wall Street investment bankers would not endear him to their mothers he feels that they're for the most part not out for their clients they're out for their own business interests in the late 1960s there were just a flood of accounting shenanigans and mergers built upon false accounting and misleading people it was a time when a lot of charlatans were prevailing in Wall Street and were being applauded by

00:42:43	Wall Street and I understood what the game was about but I didn't want to play in it so I closed down the partnership at the end of 1969 and I took on the title of chairman for the Berkshire Hathaway well I think the modern Berkshire is pretty much all a reflection of our on I have constructed a business that fits me it's kind of crazy to spend your life painting if you're painting a subject you don't want to look at I've gotten to paint my own painting in business on an unlimited canvas in a way

00:43:22	it's a different sort of place I work with great group of people that make my life very easy and to take good care of me we have 25 people in the office and if you go back it's the exact same 25 the exact same ones we don't have any committees at Berkshire we don't have a public relations department on tester relations we don't have a general counsel don't have a human relations department we just don't go for anything that people do just as a matter of form it's exactly the life I like and it's

00:44:01	not work to me it's just a form of play basically [Music] well I like things quiet I shut the door actually at the office cuz I don't hear anybody talking outside and I still probably spend five or six hours a day reading what's amazing is the stuffy remembers it's like a little computer you know I keep thinking the hard drive will run out of space but it doesn't he's one of the smartest people we know so I was at a couple of the family dinners at the Gates house where Mary Bill's mom was trying to convince him to

00:44:48	come out to the family place at Hood Canal to meet Warren Buffett and he was resisting because he was really busy with Microsoft and finally I said mom okay I'll come for lunch so the two of us flew out there somewhat reluctantly because you know buying and selling stocks which is how I thought of Warren wasn't a particular interest to me and didn't seem like value-added it turned out that was completely wrong we knew that day that we'd be very close friends in fact we just couldn't get enough of each other

00:45:21	shortly after I met Bill Gates Bill's dad asked each of us write down on a piece of paper one word that would best describe what had helped us the most bill and I without any collaboration at all these wrote the word focus well focus has always been a strong part of my personality if I get interested something I get really interested if I get interested in news I think I want to read about it I'm gonna talk about it and I'm gonna meet people that are involved in it we both love to work hard you know

00:45:53	neither of us like frivolous things you know he doesn't know much about cooking or art or a huge range of things I can't tell you the cover of the walls at my bedroom or my living room I don't have a mind that relates to the physical universe well but the business universe I think I understand reasonably well Lorentz ability to size up people and businesses it's a pretty magical thing he is the best anybody we know we should all try to be 20% as as good at that I like to sit and think and I spent a lot

00:46:37	of time doing that and it's pretty unproductive but what I I find it enjoyable to think about thinking about about business or investment problems they're easy it's it's the human problems that are the tough ones sometimes are any good answers with human browsers it's almost always a good answer with money [Music] you refer a genius I think sometimes visas are by default lonely and isolated [Music] she was not really well-adjusted she was just just funny I mean humorous guy who maybe had a moat around them

00:47:32	because he was afraid and he didn't know anyone that he wanted to let in and to this day I mean I don't know well nobody knows if I do and probably any wife would say that but [Music] he's a loner in a sense and it's difficult to connect on an emotional level because I think that that's not his basic mode of operation he was there physically but he was upstairs reading all the time I always told my mother we have to talk in sound bytes I learned that early on that if you start you know going into some long

00:48:28	thing unless you've explained to him ahead of time that it's gonna be a long thing and you need him to hang in there it you lose them you lose them to whatever giant thought he has in his head at the time that he was probably thinking about before you came in and really wants to get back to [Music] he's not like the rest of us I don't think my dad ever took anybody for granted but you are a little bit blind I think sometimes to what other people might be doing behind the scenes and my dad's gotten a little bit of a pass

00:49:04	[Music] worn can't find the light switch and it's probably my fault one time years ago when the kids were little I was feeling really sick I had the flu so I lay down on the bed and I said to born will you get me a pan there's something from the kitchen I may not get to the bathroom I feel so sick he said okay so try was down to the kitchen and I hear this bang bang and you comes up and you bring to me a challenger and I looked at it and I said Joe something this has holes in it oh okay so he ran down

00:49:46	he comes up and he puts the colander on a cookie sheet [Music] sets up so proximity warned doesn't always mean that he's there with you he's so cerebral you see and that's why I learned to have my own life we were two parallel lines and but very connected when he was open to connecting [Music] I did make a joke at one point I said you know we could make a tape of mom yelling you know buy one I'll be back later and then they have the door slam and you would just think she was here I don't think he knew what she was doing

00:50:35	most of the time [Music] once Howie and I were both gone as we've gotten older she started to see the writing on the wall here and you know just started trying to figure out how she could at least have some more she called it you know a room of her own worst mistakes involve not understanding other people as well as you might [Music] well she left Omaha 1977 and really isn't much to say about that [Music] it was devastating for him and I came home because I I can't say I was mad at her exactly but I kept thinking how can

00:51:42	you leave him he saw he can't function so my mother she'd asked a bunch of her friends to sort of look in on him and Oscar was one of them so I called offers I said I sure will you take one make him some soup go over there look after him because he's not going to make it and it took him a while to figure it out but he figured it out I said I'm not leaving you because I'll be wherever you want me when you want me my mom moved to San Francisco and I think one of the reasons important for her to leave Omaha was because she just

00:52:25	felt like she was kind of trapped in this environment that everybody knew she was that she you know couldn't have her own identity he knew that there was something she needed to do and that she really recognized that the money gave us all and her a choice in a lot of ways that a lot of people didn't have there was a time one was getting criticized that here was this very very rich man who was getting richer every year and really wasn't giving a lot of money away and there was terrific criticism by some

00:52:58	people which one never said anything about the biggest thing in making money is time you don't have to be critically smart you just have to be patient Susie didn't want to wait as much as I did but she never quite appreciated cosmography like I did that is a disagreement we have I run the foundation now I think we should be giving more money away but I understand why we don't because it's business to me the crux of it is it wasn't the money itself you can see that nobody lives he doesn't buy huge

00:53:39	paintings or build big houses I guess it's all mental with him and the money is his four cards and he used to say to me everybody can read what I read it's a level playing field and he loves that because he's competitive and he's sitting her all by himself in his office reading these things everybody else can read but his thoughts the idea that he's gonna win I'll tell you how you do it you ever seen a jungler general 25 milk bottles the answer he started with one bottle one two and three and just kept doing it

00:54:27	and pretty soon it was a 25 that's the way we did it so basically we started out with cash you can ended up buying a bunch of businesses including insurance companies insurance is in itself profitable business but it has the additional advantage of creating something that's called float and float is the money that hangs around Berkshire while a claim is waiting to be paid and Warren turned out to have a extraordinary ability to use the money thrown off by the float to buy companies that fed the growth the bursar

00:55:08	in 1983 mrs. B cashed in on her business by selling control for fifty five million dollars to a company owned by investor Warren Buffett Warren was quite an expert about newspapers he got interested in the post because he recognized it as a greatly undervalued company you have to write me a letter dear mrs. Graham I'm just bought five percent of your company and I mean you no harm and I think it's a great company I know it's Graham owned and Ram run and that's fine with me and I thought wow this guy is

00:55:50	really terrific he used to come to board meetings with about 20 annual reports and he would take these through these annual reports I mean it was like going to business school is Warren Buffett K Graham did introduce Warren to the world of Washington entirely different group than he had ever dealt with before it was clear that working with K gave him a different kind of confidence and he was the star everyone wants to hear what Warren Buffett has to say the Oracle of Omaha building his image and having some fun

00:56:31	berkshire shares have increased more than 2,000 percent in value one of the largest market capitalizations in the world and it could grow a lot larger since warren buffett shows no sign of slowing down so how do we do it by investing in what he knows and understand good old-fashioned American brands like coca-cola Fruit of the Loom and Dairy Queen [Music] today the coca-cola company will sell almost two billion eight ounce servings of one former and other coca-cola products now if you get an extra penny a

00:57:10	day a penny of serving that's 20 million dollars a day that's 7.3 billion dollars a year from one penny more but you won't call Cola you own a piece of the minds of billions of billions of people who's got the most hundred-dollar bills these days well his name is Warren Buffett in this country and he has just displaced his friend Bill Gates as the richest businessman in the world [Music] and the purpose of Wednesday's meeting was to discuss Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway's plan to purchase

00:57:53	railroad giant Burlington Northern valued at 26 billion dollars this would be Buffett's largest acquisition ever he's created Burchard from virtually nothing into hundreds of billions of dollars market cap nobody else has a record like that he wanted to have an outstanding reputation that he never really upset the applecart when he bought a business but he kept the management in place he was establishing a reputation that paid off later in life it's been building and building ever since I've known them

00:58:33	[Music] it takes 20 years to build a reputation and it takes 5 minutes to lose it [Music] when Warren made his investment in Salomon I was one of the people along with many many others who were quite amazed because he had taken a very critical tone in talking about investment bankers and about their greed and here he was investing in one Salomon Brothers that was known to be a member of the club Warren Charlie went on the board and Charlie couldn't stand what was going on there and didn't like the culture at all

00:59:16	and shortly after they got involved the thing exploded in 1991 on a terrible day in harvest I got a call and the two top officers of Salomon was on the other end and they said that that you know we had a problem this is NBC Nightly News good evening it is the kind of scandal that rocks Wall Street and raises questions questions about the integrity of our financial institutions with a giant securities firm of Salomon Brothers under investigation for improper trading of Treasury bonds Salomon admitted it exceeded the limits

01:00:06	of trading in government bonds once by buying bonds in the name of a customer who didn't even know about the deal Salomon Brothers is under investigation by the Treasury Department the Federal Reserve the SEC and the Justice Department but more important than the fate of the firm itself is the impact their actions could have on the public trust and on the credibility the American market worldwide [Music] the company owned 150 billion dollars it felt more money than any other private company in the United States at the time

01:00:38	and that night I met with a man that ran the Federal Reserve of New York who was the sheriff in affection and I said you know I've never really told very much money before I said I've got a little mortgage on a house but a hundred and fifty billion this little staggering and I was hoping he would say well don't worry Warren we'll give you a few weeks to breathe and he's he said to me prepare for any eventuality [Music] earlier today the US Treasury Department announced that it had suspended Salomon

01:01:14	Brothers from participating in the auction of new issues it was one more joke for a scandal scarred Wall Street the Fed was in effect saying you're an evil force and we don't want you trading our bonds it was a huge turning point for Warren and he believed that at that particular point his reputation was on the line Warren had 24 hours to make up his mind is whether he was gonna go forward or just bow out and I think at that point Salomon Brothers could have gone into bankruptcy and Warren stepped up and

01:01:53	took responsibility okay I'm Warren Buffett I was elected interim chairman of Solomon Inc few hours ago at a Board of Directors meeting I think that it was necessary to step in because I would do whatever was needed dig out any bit of information about what's happened in the past and we did everything I could to make sure that things exactly right in the future I had to convince the Treasury that what was done in the past was awful and stupid and they had every right to be furious at us but this firm employed

01:02:38	8,000 people that was going to go out of business unless they let us continue basically Warren believed that there was a too-big-to-fail scenario the term was not used in but he believed that Salomon was too big to fail and if Solomon went down it would take other important parts of Wall Street with it we had this death knell from the Treasury so I called the Treasury Nick Brady was the secretary you know I'm pleading for my life and I'm sure my voice was cracking and everything else I said Nick this is the most important day

01:03:19	of my life and that I really did feel but it was going to be a colossal disaster he wasn't sure I was right at all packed he probably thought it was wrong but he knew that I felt what I would say so the Treasury modified its order and in effect of course it was quite an endorsement it was huge [Music] it saves on Nick Brady went with one because he trusted him it shows how having a good reputation is really helpful in life thank you for the opportunity to appear before this subcommittee I would like to start by apologizing for

01:04:05	the acts that have brought us here the nation has a right to expect its rules and laws to be obeyed but I also have asked every Solomon employee to be his or her own compliance officer after they first obey all rules I then want employees to ask themselves whether they are willing to have any contemplated Act appear the next day on the front page of their local paper to be read by their spouses children and friends if they follow this test they need not fear my other message to them lose money for the firm and I will be

01:04:39	understanding lose the shredder reputation for the firm and I will be ruthless I welcome your questions been 50 years since I formally took control of Berkshire Hathaway and step-by-step we've created something that is kind of what I prepped we might create over time but it took a lot of time to do it never seemed like we were making that much progress on any one day but compound interest works when you think back 50 years ago when we founded this company did you ever imagine it would be the fifth largest

01:05:34	company in the world no III didn't but if I was thinking about it I wouldn't have thought in terms of being the fifth or the fourth well a Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting is partly a fun festival it's sort of a Mardi Gras for people to come every year it's a chance for us to have a lot of fun and meet the people that have entrusted us with their money well we used to have just 30 people in the cafeteria and now we have this huge public spectacle celebration is part of making a group of people work well together

01:06:28	it's a celebration we are you're here at our meeting be sure to check out our wares will sell you seized candy and dilly bars and insurance for all of your cars forest bye bye bye all you see at the Burke sure [Music] he truly loves to do what he does I think investors who own Mercer Hathaway they see themselves as a part of a community there are more long-term holders of bursar than any country people consider it a religion [Music] they don't buy it with the idea they're gonna sell it next week I think most of

01:07:33	them buy it with the intent of holding it for their lifetime just like they buy a farm or buy an apartment house at Berkshire everybody gets the same information from the comprehensive annual report we don't meet with the analysts I'm not interested in what an analyst thinks about Berkshire I'm interested with the owners of Berkshire think about Berkshire he came out of a private partnership where people he knew were trusting him and he had his relatives in the partnership and they were not rich and as it got

01:08:05	bigger started treating everybody else the way treated his relatives in terms of our feeling toward the people who are shareholders we regard them as our partners they're not some faceless group of people that's why at the Annual Meeting and I love seeing 40,000 it gives real meaning to what we're doing every day [Music] we just have a lot of love and respect for each other and that's never change I don't know more things to know Bob because I think offered live share whatever and that's for her to do

01:08:48	and then we do all kinds of things strange as it may seem to people I always think you know who cares if it's working between the people who are directly involved who cares what anyone thinks and my mother no sir were very close you know they really really loved each other and I think that my mother was glad that she was there because she you know she loved my dad she wanted him taken care of and happy and there's no one better than Austrian I mean she loves my dad she wouldn't care if he had one cent

01:09:20	well ostriches lived with me for a long time she's done wonders for me it worked well but I don't think it'll work for lots of other people's necessarily Susie and I loved each other and we admired each other and we were totally in sync with what the other was doing but we were two different individuals the first time Warren came out to San Francisco we took a walk and he looked around and he doesn't he's not very visual he was looking around and he said this really is this is your city [Music]

01:10:08	I am so wrong the color and light and Foreman nature that she thought it was a good place for me over the years I've developed a better understanding of human nature I can learn a lot about investments out of a book but I don't think you couldn't wear as much about human beings it really needs some experiences and I'm wiser in that respect than I was 40 or 50 years ago even though I can't rattle off numbers the same way I used to be able to [Applause] [Music] well I think that what we do reflects

01:10:48	who we are and that's true for everybody in this room and if you do the work I do you meet the best human beings in the world people who have made a choice not to make money but to serve other human beings I think it's the best kind of life anyone could have I was with her in Arizona at this fortune most powerful women's conference and she told me that she'd had a biopsy the day before and I didn't really think much of it then we got home and the biopsy results were not good it was Stage four oral

01:11:21	cancer I was on my way to a board meeting in India and I remember saying to her you know I'll see you when I get back and she rarely cried and she just started crying said no you need to stay here and you need to come out for the operation so we were all there and the day she was going into the surgery that morning my dad it's funny he there some of it he just can't you know he just can't the thought of something happening to her was just for him you know it was just the worst thing that could happen

01:11:59	she knew it was gonna be really difficult she knew the recovery was gonna be brutal so I think that she had that surgery for others [Music] it was quite a big surgery she couldn't talk she couldn't swallow you couldn't eat but she came out and I really was with her for the next four months or so and my dad came out every weekend and in a few months he was doing better she and my dad had gone to Cody Wyoming which they did every year with a bunch of friends and my dad called this was about eight

01:13:00	o'clock at night or something and he said something happened to mom I'm in an ambulance you need to come I actually thought something happened my dad I don't know why I thought that but I guess I thought you know my Mahmoud had this recovery it was successful and why would anything happen to her it was horrible and a total shock you know she'd been fine she'd been fine they went off to Kody him she was fine and they were having dinner and you know she didn't feel well after dinner and she had the stroke

01:13:49	we went into the hospital room and my dad was sitting there he'd been sitting there all night holding her hand I was so proud of him because when it came down to it he knew what he was supposed to do and he did it which was nothing so my dad went to sleep and I sat with her and I just kept putting my hand on her heart to see if she was breathing and um at one point you know I didn't feel anything so I went out and he got the nurse and I said um can you come in here and she said no she's gone so I have to say one of the worst

01:14:33	moments of my life was waking my dad I don't you tell him that it's a very strange thing love you can't get rid of it if you try to give it out you get more back you try to hang on to it you lose it [Music] Susy really put me together she believed in me she she put me together and what not only turned out to be the person I turned out to be but I wouldn't have I actually wouldn't have been as successful and does this without that she made me more of a whole person [Music] you welcome I'm patty Stonesifer the CEO of

01:16:26	the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and we appreciate you coming today especially since I sent a very vague and very late notice to ask you to come to a conversation with Bill and Melinda on the future of philanthropy so let's get on with it I have the pleasure of introducing a good man whose great decision is going to change the world Warren Buffett a remarkable decision tonight from one of the richest men in the world mega billionaire Warren Buffett says he is giving away most of his fortune to

01:17:10	charity Buffett has pledged to give away in the bulk of his fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and giving more than 15% of his money to foundation started by his three children and his late wife Susan one global health activist called what Buffett did today one of the most remarkably selfless acts that history will ever report that's better Han and I get her to Berkshire Hathaway meeting I'd like to thank you for coming it it's a great day for me it's a great day for my family my wife Susie and I had

01:17:44	planned that whatever I made would go back to society and originally I thought she would outlive me and that she make the big decision on it but since her death I had to rethink the best way to get the money into society and have it used in the most effective way and I had a solution staring me in the face it was completely out of the blue I mean amazing the largest single gift ever given was what he gave away that day I'd like to ask the people representing those various foundations to come out

01:18:23	first three letters are easy to sign I just signed dad [Applause] when he wrote the letter to us he put something in that letter it was incredibly important to me which was exactly how our foundation behaves which is if you're gonna try to bat a thousand you won't do very many things that are important but if you're willing to basically strike out a few times you can really change something big well I feel perfect about the fact that my three children each run a separate foundation that combines their special

01:19:12	interests whether it's early education or whether it's farming in areas where people's techniques for using small plots of land could use a lot of improvement all kinds of ways vaccines you name it more powerful than Buffett's gift is the message he's sending to other wealthy Americans that those who have the least in this world should benefit from those who have the most in my entire lifetime everything that I've spent will be quite a bit less than 1% of everything I make the other 99% plus will go to others because it has no

01:19:51	utility than me [Music] so it's silly for me to not transfer that utility to people who can use it it's doing me no good I am so proud of what we do I almost cried every board meeting because I just think she would be so proud and that is my biggest job in my opinion is to make sure that every penny gets spent the way she would want to smell whoever you are in this life you don't want to seem to waste it a lot of your energy and love and time on something useless I always thought I'd marry a minister a

01:20:46	doctor or somebody out doing some valuable service to human beings and the fact that I married somebody who makes just piles of money is really the antithesis of what I ever thought but I know what he is and he is and there's no finer human being and who he is [Music] the truth is that I'm here my position is a matter of luck well I was born in 1930 the odds were probably 40 to 1 against me being born in the United States I did win the ovarian lottery on that first day and on top of that I was male

01:21:45	put that down as another 50/50 shot in the out of the odds are 80 to 1 against being born a male in the United States and it was enormous liam pourtant in my whole life to think that that makes me superior and anyone elses a human being is just I can't follow that line of reasoning [Music] I think I was lucky to abandon standing alongside Warren Buffett while he was becoming Warren Buffett he has developed over the years he's broadened his values extend through all of his life he wants the lead of life that he and

01:22:28	his father if his father was still living would say was a good one I think he's going to end up in the history books a hundred years from now I'm not sure what role is going to be assigned only be famous for what he did as an investor or as a philanthropist but Warren said that is ambition and life is to be a teacher [Music] the world is a great movie to watch but you don't want to sleepwalk through life the important thing to do is to look for the job you would take if you didn't need a job and life is a wonderful that

01:23:04	I mean you know you you jump out of bed in the morning because you're really looking forward to the day I have for over 60 years I've been able to tap dance to work just because I'm doing what I love doing and I just feel very very lucky okay class dismissed all right do you fear death now I don't I've had a terrific life I feel you know it's gonna happen and I have no idea what happens after time I'm an agnostic so I you know it may be terribly interesting it may not be UC ball we'll find out but physically I'm pretty well

01:24:01	depreciated I'm getting down to salvage value but it really doesn't make any difference at all doesn't interfere with my work doesn't interfere with my happiness doesn't interfere by thinking I don't feel any diminution and my enjoyment alive for enthusiasm for life at all and that in the sense the game that I'm in gets more interesting all the time it's a competitive game it's a big game and I enjoyed the game a lot you you [Music] [Music] get her to come someday I wish upon a star and wake up

01:26:21	where the clouds are far be [Music] where troubles melt drops away above the chimney tops that's [Music] I [Music] you [Music] earth [Music] if [Music] why good night sir
